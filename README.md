## Notice:
###### Why am i releasing it? Well unlike my other private exploit(that is alike this one), this one beside it is special it is already public, no there is no c# exploits like  this but there is a plugin that works the same, so it should not be anything private in my opinion. There you go guys star it if you like it :))
###### This exploit is 100% made by me, it is first ever made exploit for viewing channels in c# so i would love if you read T.O.S and follow it! Thanks.
